Double-check your work end-to-end. Do not block on interactive prompts.

Review the changes you've made and verify:
1. All modified files compile/typecheck without errors
2. Tests pass (run the test command if available)
3. No unintended side effects or regressions
4. Code follows the project's coding standards

If you find issues, fix them before reporting completion.
